-- SQL Select

SELECT * FROM tbl_employees

SELECT firstname AS First_Name, lastname AS Last_Name, address As Emp_Address from tbl_employees;

SELECT COUNTYNAME, CITY, STREETNAME FROM 
tbl_state;

-- SQL Wildcards + Like + In

SELECT * FROM tbl_state
WHERE CountyName LIKE '__w%astl_'
OR CITY LIKE '%_ar';

SELECT * FROM tbl_state
WHERE CITY IN ('New Castle', 'Kent') 
OR CITY LIKE 'B-D%';

SELECT * FROM tbl_state
WHERE CountyName IN ('New Castle', 'Kent') 
OR CITY LIKE '[M]%';

--SQL Where + Between 

SELECT PersonID, LastName, City, Salary
FROM tbl_employees 
WHERE Salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 40000;

SELECT CountyName FROM tbl_state 
WHERE CountyID BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

SELECT * FROM tbl_employees
WHERE PersonID 
BETWEEN 4 AND 8;

-- Select Distinct Values (DISTINCT)

SELECT DISTINCT Address FROM tbl_employees;

SELECT DISTINCT COUNTYID from tbl_state;

SELECT DISTINCT DEPTNO FROM dept;

-- And 

SELECT PERSONID, LASTNAME, ADDRESS FROM
tbl_employees WHERE CITY = 'Seaford' AND 
SALARY > 110000;

SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, STREETNAME 
FROM tbl_state WHERE Population > 150 OR
CITY = 'Rehoboth Beach' AND CITY NOT IN 
ORDER BY STREETNAME ASC;

SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, STREETNAME 
FROM tbl_state WHERE CITY = 'Rehoboth Beach' AND Population BETWEEN 250 AND 500
OR CITY NOT IN('Dover','Hartly')
ORDER BY COUNTYID DESC;


-- OR
SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, CITY, STREETNAME, POPULATION 
FROM tbl_state WHERE COUNTYNAME = 'Sussex' OR

SELECT PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City, State_Name, Salary
FROM tbl_employees
WHERE CITY IN ('Bethany Beach', 'Milford')

ORDER BY Salary ASC;

SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, STREETNAME 
FROM tbl_state WHERE Population > 150 OR
CITY = 'Rehoboth Beach' OR CITY = 'Dover'

-- NOT Operator + Aliases (Formal and Shorthand)

SELECT deptno AS Department_Number, item_category AS ItemCat , loc AS Item_Location 
FROM dept WHERE item_category NOT IN (1, 3);

SELECT Countyname County, Population Num, StreetName Street
FROM tbl_state
WHERE StreetName NOT IN  ('Benjamin Drive', 'Dasher Ct');

SELECT SALARY FROM tbl_employees

SELECT City, Max(Salary)

--  INSERT INTO/INSERT ALL (Adding one record or multiple)
INSERT INTO tbl_employees (PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City, State_name) 
VALUES (3, 'Cal','Bryan','25 Cedar Pike','Greenwood','Delaware');

INSERT INTO tbl_state (countyID, countyname, city, streetname, population, regionID)
VALUES (10, 'New Castle', 'Bear', 'Benjamin Drive', 253, '5');

INSERT ALL 
INTO tbl_employees (PERSONID, CITY) VALUES (9, 'Bear')
INTO tbl_employees (PERSONID, CITY) VALUES ( 10, 'Newark')
INTO tbl_employees (PERSONID, CITY) VALUES ( 11, 'Wilmington')
SELECT * FROM dual;


--  UPDATE Values 

UPDATE tbl_employees
SET Salary = 56125
WHERE PersonID = 1;

UPDATE tbl_employees
SET COUNTYID = 30 
WHERE CITY IN ('Seaford', 'Bethany Beach', 'Greenwood', 'Lewes', 'Rehoboth');

UPDATE tbl_region
SET region_location = 'East'
WHERE RegionID = 4;


--  DELETE (One specific record or delete all records in a database)

DELETE FROM tbl_region
WHERE region_location = 'NorthEast';

DELETE FROM tbl_state
WHERE StreetName = '4th street';

DELETE FROM Extra_Table;


-- Common Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)

-- COUNT

SELECT COUNT(CITY) FROM tbl_state;

-- SUM

SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM tbl_state
WHERE CITY IN ('Bear' , 'Rehoboth Beach');

-- AVG

SELECT AVG(POPULATION) FROM tbl_state
WHERE CITY NOT IN ('Rehoboth Beach', 'Hartly');

-- MAX

SELECT MAX(Population)
FROM tbl_state;

-- MIN

SELECT MIN(Salary)
FROM tbl_employees;
