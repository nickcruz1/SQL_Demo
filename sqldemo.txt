***** DDL – Data Definition Language. *****

-- CREATE Table Syntax
1. CREATE TABLE tbl_employees (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255),
    State_name varchar (255),
    Primary Key (PersonID)
);
2. CREATE TABLE tbl_nation (
    nationID int,
    regionID int NOT NULL,
    stateID int NOT NULL,
    population int NOT NULL,
    Primary Key (nationID)
);
3. CREATE TABLE tbl_region (
    regionID int,
    nationID int,
    stateID int,
    countyname varchar(255),
    city varchar(255),
    streetname varchar(255),
    population int,
    Primary Key (regionID),
    Foreign Key (nationID) References tbl_nation(nationID)
);

-- ALTER Table 
1. ALTER TABLE tbl_employees 
ADD Salary int;
2. ALTER TABLE tbl_employees
ADD COUNTYID INT;
3. ALTER TABLE tbl_state
ADD citydescription varchar(255);

--  DROP Table / DB
1. DROP TABLE tbl_region;
2. DROP DATABASE my_test_db;
3. DROP TABLE employee_other;

***** DQL – Data Query Language. *****
-- SQL Select
1. SELECT * FROM tbl_employees
2. SELECT firstname AS First_Name, lastname AS Last_Name, address As Emp_Address from tbl_employees;
3. SELECT COUNTYNAME, CITY, STREETNAME FROM 
tbl_state;

-- SQL Wildcards + Like + In
1. SELECT * FROM tbl_state
WHERE CountyName LIKE '__w%astl_'
OR CITY LIKE '%_ar';

2. SELECT * FROM tbl_state
WHERE CITY IN ('New Castle', 'Kent') 
OR CITY LIKE 'B-D%';

3. SELECT * FROM tbl_state
WHERE CountyName IN ('New Castle', 'Kent') 
OR CITY LIKE '[M]%';

--SQL Where + Between 
1. SELECT PersonID, LastName, City, Salary
FROM tbl_employees 
WHERE Salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 40000;
2. SELECT CountyName FROM tbl_state 
WHERE CountyID BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
3. SELECT * FROM tbl_employees
WHERE PersonID 
BETWEEN 4 AND 8;

-- Select Distinct Values (DISTINCT)
1. SELECT DISTINCT Address FROM tbl_employees;
2. SELECT DISTINCT COUNTYID from tbl_state;
3. SELECT DISTINCT DEPTNO FROM dept;

-- And 
1. SELECT PERSONID, LASTNAME, ADDRESS FROM
tbl_employees WHERE CITY = 'Seaford' AND 
SALARY > 110000;
2. SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, STREETNAME 
FROM tbl_state WHERE Population > 150 OR
CITY = 'Rehoboth Beach' AND CITY NOT IN 
ORDER BY STREETNAME ASC;
3. SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, STREETNAME 
FROM tbl_state WHERE CITY = 'Rehoboth Beach' AND Population BETWEEN 250 AND 500
OR CITY NOT IN('Dover','Hartly')
ORDER BY COUNTYID DESC;


-- OR
1. SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, CITY, STREETNAME, POPULATION 
FROM tbl_state WHERE COUNTYNAME = 'Sussex' OR
CITY IN('Rehoboth Beach', 'Hartly','Dover');

2. SELECT PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City, State_Name, Salary
FROM tbl_employees
WHERE CITY IN ('Bethany Beach', 'Milford')
AND LastName LIKE '%ol_' OR LastName LIKE 'Smi%'
ORDER BY Salary ASC;

3. SELECT COUNTYID, COUNTYNAME, STREETNAME 
FROM tbl_state WHERE Population > 150 OR
CITY = 'Rehoboth Beach' OR CITY = 'Dover'
ORDER BY STREETNAME ASC;


-- NOT Operator + Aliases (Formal and Shorthand)
1. SELECT deptno AS Department_Number, item_category AS ItemCat , loc AS Item_Location 
FROM dept WHERE item_category NOT IN (1, 3);
2. SELECT Countyname County, Population Num, StreetName Street
FROM tbl_state
WHERE StreetName NOT IN  ('Benjamin Drive', 'Dasher Ct');
3. SELECT SALARY FROM tbl_employees
WHERE CITY NOT IN ('Milford', 'Seaford');

--  INSERT INTO/INSERT ALL (Adding one record or multiple)
1. INSERT INTO tbl_employees (PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, City, State_name) 
VALUES (3, 'Cal','Bryan','25 Cedar Pike','Greenwood','Delaware');
2. INSERT INTO tbl_state (countyID, countyname, city, streetname, population, regionID)
VALUES (10, 'New Castle', 'Bear', 'Benjamin Drive', 253, '5');
3. INSERT ALL 
INTO tbl_employees (PERSONID, CITY) VALUES (9, 'Bear')
INTO tbl_employees (PERSONID, CITY) VALUES ( 10, 'Newark')
INTO tbl_employees (PERSONID, CITY) VALUES ( 11, 'Wilmington')
SELECT * FROM dual;


--  UPDATE Values 
1. UPDATE tbl_employees
SET Salary = 56125
WHERE PersonID = 1;
2. UPDATE tbl_employees
SET COUNTYID = 30 
WHERE CITY IN ('Seaford', 'Bethany Beach', 'Greenwood', 'Lewes', 'Rehoboth');
3. UPDATE tbl_region
SET region_location = 'East'
WHERE RegionID = 4;


--  DELETE (One specific record or delete all records in a database)
1. DELETE FROM tbl_region
WHERE region_location = 'NorthEast';
2. DELETE FROM tbl_state
WHERE StreetName = '4th street';
3. DELETE FROM Extra_Table;


-- Common Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)

-- COUNT
1. SELECT COUNT(CITY) FROM tbl_state;

-- SUM
2. SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM tbl_state
WHERE CITY IN ('Bear' , 'Rehoboth Beach');

-- AVG
3. SELECT AVG(POPULATION) FROM tbl_state
WHERE CITY NOT IN ('Rehoboth Beach', 'Hartly');

-- MAX
4. SELECT MAX(Population)
FROM tbl_state;

-- MIN
5. SELECT MIN(Salary)
FROM tbl_employees;
